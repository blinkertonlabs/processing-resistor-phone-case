# Resistor Icon for a Phone Case
[Carved](https://www.carved.com/) offers the option to create custom phone cases, where a design is laser-etched into the wood.  
There were no resistor icon offered in the available graphics and I couldn't find one I liked through image searches, so Processing was used to create a resisotr icon and export it as an SVG.  The exported image could then be uploaded to the Carved site, and used for the custom phone case.
