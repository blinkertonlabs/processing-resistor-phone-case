# Resistor Icon for a Phone Case
The Processing languaged was utilized to create a resistor icon for a custom phone case.

[Carved](https://www.carved.com/) offers the option to create custom phone cases made out of wood, where a design is laser-etched into the wood.  There was no resistor icon offered in the available graphics, so Processing was used to create a resisotr icon, and export it as an SVG.
